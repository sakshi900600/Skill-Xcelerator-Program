# # Given a string of sorted alphanumeric characters, find missing ranges.  
# #  Input: "12346789BCDF" â†’ Output: ["5", "A", "E"]


# # want clarification: 
# # 1. if digit in input will start from 2/3 then whether 1,2 will be consider as missing or not. 


# I have assumed that: 
# 1.  for char it will be always between A to last char in given string and i have to find out all missing char between them and if there is no missing char then add the char after last char

# 2.  for number it will be always from 1 to 9 but missing will be only b/n 1 to last digit in num. if not then digit after last digit and if last digit is 9 then nothing is missing. 



# s = "12346789ABCDEF"  # output: ['5', 'G']
s = "2346789BCDF"  # output: ['5', 'G']
