## Doubts:
### linkedlist implementation:
currently our code works: if a valid position but when i try to perform operation on 20th pos and ll size is 5 then it simply perform that operation on last element isn't it wrong??

Or i think coz linkedlist is dynamic so certainly it will create link at end whenever new node comes. so there is no point of position. 


### maximum width between 2 nodes on horizontal level:
here basically we are doing max_hd-min_hd  , so can we write the same code as written in top-view and at last instead printing top view return last-first value from sorted dict keys. is it acceptable ???? 









### hw-4:
ques 6: this output is wrong. ('photosynthesis' with 11 unique characters)
ques 20, doubt: here A and a is same but B and b is not same why????????


### cw-4
ques 3: count freq of all elem in list. I used dict but in dict 1 and True both is considered same.
