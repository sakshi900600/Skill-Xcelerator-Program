# highest value palindrome:
# given a string of no and an integer value k. you can only perform k operations/changes in the given string such that that string become a palindrome and through this you need to find the largest palindrom value and return it: 

# example: 
# s = "1231" , k=3
# Make 3 replacements to get "9339".

# s = "12321", k=1
# Make 1 replacement to get "12921".
